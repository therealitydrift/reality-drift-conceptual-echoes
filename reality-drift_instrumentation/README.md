## **Instrumentation Frameworks**

This folder contains operational tools derived from the Reality Drift framework.

These materials focus on measurement and diagnosis rather than conceptual explanation. They provide structured methods for assessing how meaning, reference, and reality alignment change within complex symbolic systems.

## **Purpose**

Instrumentation frameworks are designed to:

- Translate conceptual ideas into operational criteria

- Support evaluation of semantic fidelity and epistemic integrity

- Provide diagnostic language for analyzing synthetic or recursive knowledge environments

These artifacts function as technical scaffolding rather than interpretive theory.

## **Relationship to Conceptual Echoes**

While conceptual echoes examine how ideas propagate and transform, instrumentation frameworks focus on how those transformations can be observed, measured, and evaluated.

They operate as analytical tools within the broader Reality Drift ecosystem.
