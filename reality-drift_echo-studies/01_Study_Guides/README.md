# Study Guides

This directory contains study guides derived from materials in this repository.

The documents here reorganize existing concepts into structured formats intended to support reading, discussion, and applied analysis. They are designed to make complex ideas easier to examine without altering their underlying meaning.

These materials do not introduce new theory or definitions.

## Purpose

These study guides serve three primary functions:

- Reorganize existing material into usable reference formats  
- Support teaching, group discussion, or independent study  
- Enable applied examination of concepts without modifying canonical definitions

## Relationship to Source Material

The canonical record of the Reality Drift framework is maintained separately in the Reality Drift Library:

https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift-library

All materials in this directory are secondary derivatives based on that body of work. They should be read as interpretive aids, not as authoritative sources.

## Notes

This directory is intentionally limited in scope.

The documents are designed to clarify, not to extend or revise the underlying framework.
