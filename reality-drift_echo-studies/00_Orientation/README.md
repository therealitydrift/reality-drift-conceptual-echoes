# Orientation

This directory contains orientation materials for this repository.

The materials establish shared terminology and framing to support consistent interpretation across files.

These documents are not original theory and are not intended to extend or revise the Reality Drift framework.

## Contents

- RD-ECHO-Aphorisms_Reality-Drift.pdf  
  A compact set of aphorisms derived from Reality Drift concepts, intended to observe how meaning compresses when expressed as minimal statements.

- RD-ECHO-Canonical-Glossary_Reality-Drift.pdf  
  A glossary adapted from canonical Reality Drift terminology, structured to examine how definitions persist or shift when removed from their original theoretical context.

- RD-ECHO-Index_Modern-Questions.pdf  
  An index of contemporary questions used as probes for studying conceptual drift, reframing, and institutional uptake.

---

## Purpose

These materials serve three functions:

- Establish baseline vocabulary and framing for echo studies  
- Provide controlled reference artifacts for comparison  
- Support analysis of how concepts propagate, simplify, or stabilize outside their source framework

## Relationship to Reality Drift

The canonical record of the Reality Drift framework is maintained separately in the Reality Drift Library:

https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift-library

Materials in this repository should be read as secondary artifacts derived from that body of work.

## Notes

This directory is intentionally limited in scope.  
It is meant to orient readers, not to explain the full framework.
