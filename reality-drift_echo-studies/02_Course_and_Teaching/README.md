# Course and Teaching Materials

This directory contains teaching-oriented materials derived from concepts in this repository.

The documents here adapt existing ideas into formats suitable for coursework, workshops, or instructional settings. They translate conceptual frameworks into structured learning artifacts without introducing new theory.

## Relationship to Source Material

The canonical definitions, frameworks, and primary essays are maintained separately in the Reality Drift Library:

https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift-library

Teaching materials in this directory are secondary derivatives. They are instructional interpretations, not authoritative statements of the framework itself.

## Notes

This directory may expand to include additional syllabi, lesson structures, or teaching outlines.

All materials here should be read as pedagogical adaptations rather than original research contributions.
