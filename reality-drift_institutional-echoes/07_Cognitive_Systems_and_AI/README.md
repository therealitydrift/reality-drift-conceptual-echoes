# Cognitive Systems and AI

This directory contains analyses of cognitive systems under conditions of algorithmic mediation, assistive automation, and large-scale language modeling.

The focus is on how human cognition changes when external systems participate in perception, memory, reasoning, and meaning formation, without fully sharing human constraints or accountability.

## Contents

- RD-ECHO_2025_Whitaker_Cognitive-Thinning-in-the-AI-Era.pdf  
  An analysis of how cognitive effort, interpretive depth, and sense-making capacity can thin when AI systems optimize for fluency, speed, and surface coherence rather than grounded understanding.

---

## Purpose

The materials in this directory exist to:

- Examine second-order cognitive effects of AI-assisted thinking  
- Study how external cognitive systems reshape attention, judgment, and effort  
- Observe how intelligence can appear to increase while comprehension weakens  

These documents are intended for researchers, AI practitioners, system designers, educators, and analysts concerned with long-term cognitive integrity rather than short-term performance gains.

## Relationship to Canonical Work

Primary theory related to Reality Drift, cognitive drift, semantic fidelity, and compression-based models of meaning is maintained in the Reality Drift Library:

https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift-library

Materials in this directory apply those concepts to human–AI cognitive interaction rather than advancing the core framework itself.

## Notes

Cognitive systems do not fail when tools become more powerful.

They fail when effort is displaced faster than understanding can stabilize.

When reasoning is outsourced without shared constraints, fluency can replace sense-making, and coherence can replace contact with reality.

These materials document cognitive thinning as a structural risk of AI-mediated environments, not as a moral failing or a rejection of technological progress.

Institutional names and formats may be fictionalized or composited to reflect systemic dynamics rather than specific organizations.
