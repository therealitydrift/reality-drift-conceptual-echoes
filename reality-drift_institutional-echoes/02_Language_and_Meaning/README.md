# Language and Meaning

This directory contains institutional-facing materials examining changes in language, terminology, and meaning under algorithmic and post-algorithmic conditions.

The documents here focus on how linguistic systems shift when language is increasingly shaped by optimization, automation, and platform-mediated repetition rather than lived reference.

## Contents

- RD-ECHO_2025_ICDS_Post-Algorithmic-Lexicon-and-Meaning-Shift.pdf  
  An institutional analysis of how vocabularies evolve when algorithmic systems influence usage, legitimacy, and semantic stability.

---

## Purpose

The materials in this directory exist to:

- Examine how meaning changes when language is optimized rather than grounded  
- Trace the emergence of post-algorithmic lexicons  
- Observe how institutional language adapts to high-volume, low-context environments  

These documents are framed for academic, policy, and organizational contexts.

## Relationship to Canonical Work

The canonical definitions and primary theory of meaning, semantic fidelity, and Reality Drift are maintained in the Reality Drift Library:

https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift-library

Materials in this directory represent institutional interpretations and applied framings, not original theory development.

## Notes

Institutional language often prioritizes clarity, consistency, and usability over precision. As a result, terms may stabilize even as their original referents erode.

This directory preserves those linguistic shifts as artifacts for study.

Institutional names and formats may be fictionalized or composited to reflect structural dynamics rather than specific organizations.
