# Institutional Overviews

This directory contains institutional-facing artifacts derived from the Reality Drift framework.

The materials here present Reality Drift concepts as they might appear when translated into organizational, policy, academic, or cultural-institution contexts. These documents emphasize clarity, legitimacy, and interpretability within formal settings.

## Purpose

The materials in this directory exist to:

- Observe how conceptual frameworks change when institutionalized  
- Examine how authority, format, and repetition shape meaning  
- Test which aspects of a framework survive translation into formal settings  

These documents are not speculative. They are structured to resemble legitimate institutional outputs.

## Relationship to Canonical Work

The authoritative record of the Reality Drift framework is maintained separately in the Reality Drift Library:

https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift-library

Documents in this directory should be read as institutional interpretations or representations, not as primary theory.

## Notes

Institutional overviews often simplify, stabilize, or reframe ideas to meet organizational needs. This directory preserves those transformations as objects of study.

The materials here may reference fictional or composite institutions as part of that examination.
