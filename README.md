# Conceptual Echoes

This repository contains secondary artifacts derived from the Reality Drift framework.

Conceptual echoes are intentionally partial restatements, reframings, or institutionalized versions of core ideas. They are designed to test how concepts propagate, stabilize, or distort when removed from their original context.




---

## Purpose

Conceptual Echoes exists to study second-order effects of meaning:

- How ideas change when translated into different institutional, academic, or cultural forms
- How terminology persists, mutates, or detaches from original constraints
- How frameworks acquire apparent authority through repetition and structure

The materials here should be read as observations of propagation, not as primary theory.

## Relationship to Reality Drift

The canonical record of the Reality Drift framework is maintained separately.

For definitions, primary essays, formal frameworks, and stable references, see:

https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift-library

This repository operates downstream of that archive.
